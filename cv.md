# **About me**
### Hi, my name is Danil and I am 20 years old. I live in St. Petersburg and study here at SPbSETU "LETI" under the program "Radio Engineering: computer vision systems". I like to do programming, trying a lot of new things, and before I settled on JavaScript, I managed to try a lot of directions and programming languages.  
<br>

# **My Skills**
* ### JavaScript
* ### HTML5
* ### CSS3
* ### Git
<br>

# **Example of code**
### _You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N._
<br>

```
function findOutlier(integers){
    let oddArr = [];
    let evenArr = [];
    integers.forEach((el) => el % 2 == 0 ? evenArr.push(el) : oddArr.push(el));
    return oddArr.length == 1 ? oddArr[0] : evenArr[0];
  }
```
